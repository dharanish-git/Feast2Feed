# 🍲 Feast2Feed – Web-Based Food Donation Platform  

**Feast2Feed** is a web-based food donation platform designed to connect **donors** with **NGOs** to reduce food wastage and feed underprivileged communities.  
The project addresses a critical social problem: while large amounts of food are wasted daily from **households, restaurants, weddings, and events**, countless people—especially **children in orphanages** and **individuals in shelters**—struggle to get even a single meal.  

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement  

- **Global Issue**: Nearly **one-third of all food produced** worldwide is wasted every year.  
- **India**: Around **21 million tonnes of food** is wasted annually, despite millions of people being undernourished.  
- **Tamil Nadu / Chennai**: The situation is severe, with **Chennai alone generating ~25 tonnes of food waste every day**.

## 💡 Solution  

**Feast2Feed** provides a **service-based, not-for-profit solution** to bridge the gap between **food surplus** and **food scarcity**.  

### How It Works:
1. **Donors** (households, restaurants, event managers) log in and post surplus food donations.  
2. **NGOs** log in to their dashboards to view available donations in real time.  
3. NGOs claim donations, arrange pickup/delivery, and distribute food to orphanages, shelters, or street communities.  
4. **Donors** can track the full donation lifecycle: *claimed → picked up → delivered*.  
5. The platform integrates **GPS-to-address conversion** and sends **automated email notifications** to keep all parties updated.
